## About

As a former researcher myself, I worked very closely with my team and often find our meeting time not long enough for every member to share. I created this "Debrief Zone" app using React in hope to provide a virtual environment for team members to continue sharing after the meeting. That way, everyone is included and every voice is being heard.
